Hello, its <b>1280px</b>! I'm a 17-year-old lazy student from Russia

I like doing nice things with JavaScript. I'm learning new things about it and its libraries, slowly progressing on a <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend">frontender roadmap</a>, although it's pretty hard :D<br>
You can see some of my projects on this GitHub profile.

I'm also doing small videos and animations for YouTube and making Minecraft JE resourcepacks (check my PMC, there's a lot of packs!!)

⚡ The best way to reach me is to drop me a letter on my Reddit profile. I check it quite often!
