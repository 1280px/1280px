Hi, its 1280px! I'm 16-year-old lazy studert from Russia. 

I like doing nice things with HTML and CSS. I'm also slowly learning JS, although it's quite difficult :D<br>
You can see some of my projects on this GitHub profile

I also doing small videos and animations for YouTube and making Minecraft JE resourcepacks (check my PMC, there's a lot of packs!!)

âš¡ The best way to reach me is drop me a letter on my Reddit profile, I check it quite often
